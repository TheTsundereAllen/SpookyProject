Took 10 Minutes for the First Commit, Don't judge my CODE PLS :)

Only created the general system, I need to use my frikin literacies to write some crappy scripts later :)

Halloween Activity - Partner Activity

For today’s activity, you will be writing a “Choose Your Own Adventure” game. You need to use a loop so that they can freely move from room to room and back again. 

There need to be at least six rooms or destinations, and at least two different ways for the game to end.

Make it more creepy and be creative to find a way to spook the user. Also, think of a way for the user to either survive or die.

(Optional) You can add (guess the correct word/answer) in some rooms if the user guesses it correctly, it will be the way to survive and go on to a different room.

(Optional) Give the user lives and if the lives run out they lose the adventure.

Include methods in your code for the organization.

Sample output to get you started:
> Let's start your adventure…

> You are in a creepy house! Would you like to go “upstairs”  or into the “kitchen”?

> kitchen

> There is a long countertop with dirty dishes everywhere. Off to one side, there is a refrigerator. You hear a noise inside. Do you want to open the “refrigerator” or go “back”?

> back
